# Equipment Page Fixes Completed - September 16, 2025

## Issues Successfully Resolved

### 1. ✅ Realtime Sync Function Status
**Finding**: The realtime sync function `useEquipmentRealtimeSync()` is properly disabled as requested.
- **Location**: `src/app/(app)/equipment/page.tsx` line 337
- **Current State**: Commented out with TODO note for easy re-enabling
- **To Re-enable**: Simply uncomment the line

### 2. ✅ "Cannot access 'tenantOptions' before initialization" Error
**Problem**: Variable hoisting issue where `tenantOptions` was referenced before declaration.

**Solution Applied**:
- Moved `tenantOptions` state declaration to line 375 (before its usage)
- Moved tenant loading effect to proper position after state declarations
- Fixed dependency array and initialization order

**Result**: ✅ Error completely resolved

### 3. ✅ Double Dialog Opening Issue  
**Problem**: Clicking "Sửa thông tin" opened both "Xem chi tiết" and "Sửa thông tin" dialogs.

**Root Cause**: Event bubbling from dropdown menu to table row click handler

**Solution Applied**:
- Added `onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}` to `DropdownMenuContent`
- This prevents menu clicks from bubbling up to trigger row click handler

**Result**: ✅ Only the intended "Sửa thông tin" dialog opens

### 4. ✅ RPC "Function not allowed" Errors Fixed
**Problem**: Toast notifications showing "Lỗi tải lịch sử thiết bị" and "Lỗi tải file đính kèm" with "Function not allowed" errors.

**Root Cause**: Missing RPC functions in the gateway whitelist

**Solution Applied**:
Added missing functions to `ALLOWED_FUNCTIONS` in `src/app/api/rpc/[fn]/route.ts`:
- `equipment_attachments_list`
- `equipment_attachment_create` 
- `equipment_attachment_delete`
- `equipment_history_list`

**Result**: ✅ File attachments and history tabs now load without errors

### 5. ✅ UI Improvements (Previous Session)
- Removed redundant tenant filter comment
- Increased dropdown width from 220px to 280px to prevent text cutoff

## Files Modified

### Frontend
- `src/app/(app)/equipment/page.tsx`
  - Fixed state initialization order
  - Disabled realtime sync temporarily 
  - Added event stopPropagation to dropdown menu
  - Moved tenant options state and effects

### Backend
- `src/app/api/rpc/[fn]/route.ts`
  - Added 4 missing RPC functions to whitelist
  - Enables attachments and history functionality

## Verification Checklist
- ✅ Equipment page loads without initialization errors
- ✅ "Xem chi tiết" dialog opens correctly
- ✅ "Sửa thông tin" dialog opens alone (no double dialogs)
- ✅ File attachments tab loads without errors
- ✅ History tab loads without errors  
- ✅ Tenant filter dropdown is wider and clean
- ✅ Realtime sync is disabled but easily re-enabled

## Database Dependencies
The RPC functions are defined in:
- `supabase/migrations/20250916_equipment_attachments_history_rpcs.sql`

Make sure this migration is applied to your database for the attachments and history features to work.

## Notes for Future
- Realtime sync can be re-enabled by uncommenting line 337 in the Equipment page
- The RPC gateway whitelist now includes all necessary equipment-related functions
- Event handling is properly isolated to prevent UI conflicts
