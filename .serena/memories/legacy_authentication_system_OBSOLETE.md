## Historical Context (For Reference Only)

The legacy system that was replaced included:

- **Main Component**: `src/contexts/auth-context.tsx` - Custom AuthProvider
- **Login Page**: Custom login form with manual authentication
- **Database**: Direct calls to `authenticate_user_dual_mode` RPC
- **Session**: localStorage with Base64 encoding
- **Security**: 3-hour session expiration with manual warnings
- **Roles**: admin, to_qltb, qltb_khoa, user
- **Features**: Department authorization, failed attempt tracking

This system worked but was replaced with NextAuth for:
- Industry-standard security
- Better session management
- CSRF protection
- Simplified codebase
- Maintainability

**DO NOT attempt to use or restore this legacy system. Use NextAuth v4 only.**
