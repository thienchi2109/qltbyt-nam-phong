# Maintenance Page Regional Leader Enhancements - October 7, 2025

## Session Summary
Comprehensive security audit and UX improvements for maintenance page regional_leader permissions and facility filtering.

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. Regional Leader Equipment List Permissions ✅
**Issue:** Needed verification that regional_leader users cannot add/edit/delete equipment in maintenance plans.

**Findings:**
- ✅ "Thêm thiết bị" (Add Equipment) button: Properly hidden via `canManagePlans` check
- ✅ Save/Cancel buttons: Hidden for regional_leader
- ✅ Bulk edit controls: Hidden (schedule, assign, delete)
- ✅ Row selection: Disabled for approved plans
- ✅ Edit/Delete actions: Hidden when plan approved
- ✅ Task completion: Regional leaders cannot mark tasks complete (`canCompleteTask` check)

**Verdict:** All permissions correctly enforced. Regional leaders have READ-ONLY access.

---

### 2. Export Plan Form Button ✅
**Issue:** Regional leaders could see "Xuất phiếu KH" (Export Plan Form) button.

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// Line 2182: Added !isRegionalLeader condition
{tasks.length > 0 && !isRegionalLeader && (
  <Button variant="secondary" onClick={handleGeneratePlanForm}>
    <FileText className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
    Xuất phiếu KH
  </Button>
)}
```

**Result:** Button now hidden for regional_leader users only.

---

### 3. CRITICAL: Facility Filter RPC Security Issue ✅
**Issue:** Maintenance page called `don_vi_list()` which is GLOBAL-ONLY, causing errors for regional_leader.

**Root Cause:**
```sql
-- don_vi_list() from 20250917_don_vi_config.sql
IF v_role <> 'global' THEN
  RAISE EXCEPTION 'Forbidden' USING HINT = 'global_only';
END IF;
```

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// Line 292-294: Changed RPC call
// BEFORE: fn: 'don_vi_list' ❌ Global-only
// AFTER:  fn: 'get_facilities_with_equipment_count' ✅ Region-aware

const data = await callRpc<any[]>({
  fn: 'get_facilities_with_equipment_count',
  args: {}
});
```

**How `get_facilities_with_equipment_count()` Works:**
- Uses `allowed_don_vi_for_session_safe()` for permission checking
- **Global users:** Returns ALL facilities
- **Regional leaders:** Returns ONLY facilities in assigned `dia_ban`
- **Other roles:** Returns facilities based on their permissions

---

### 4. Client-Side Facility Filter Validation ✅
**Issue:** Needed explicit client-side security to prevent unauthorized facility access.

**Fixes Applied:**

#### A. Dropdown Population Validation (Lines 324-343)
```typescript
// Only show facilities in allowed list
const allowedFacilityIds = new Set(facilities.map(f => f.id));

const facilityMap = new Map<number, string>();
enriched Plans.forEach(plan => {
  if (plan.don_vi && plan.facility_name && allowedFacilityIds.has(plan.don_vi)) {
    facilityMap.set(plan.don_vi, plan.facility_name);
  }
});
```

#### B. Selection Security Check (Lines 345-357)
```typescript
// Verify selected facility is allowed
const allowedFacilityIds = new Set(facilities.map(f => f.id));
if (!allowedFacilityIds.has(selectedFacility)) {
  console.warn(`Facility ${selectedFacility} is not in allowed list.`);
  return enrichedPlans; // Abort filtering
}
```

#### C. Error Handling (Lines 299-302)
```typescript
catch (error: any) {
  console.error('Failed to fetch facilities:', error);
  setFacilities([]); // Fallback to empty array
}
```

---

### 5. Pagination Reset UX Enhancement ✅
**Issue:** When changing facility filter, users could end up on empty pages.

**Example Problem:**
- User on Page 5 viewing all 50 plans
- Selects "Facility A" with only 8 plans
- Still on Page 5 → Empty page

**Fix Applied (Lines 362-368):**
```typescript
// Reset pagination to page 1 when facility filter changes
React.useEffect(() => {
  setPlanPagination(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    pageIndex: 0 // Reset to first page
  }));
}, [selectedFacility]);
```

**Result:** Automatic jump to page 1 when filter changes, showing results immediately.

## Security Architecture

### Defense-in-Depth Layers

1. **Server-Side RPC Filtering** (Primary)
   - `get_facilities_with_equipment_count()` uses `allowed_don_vi_for_session_safe()`
   - Regional leaders get ONLY facilities in their `dia_ban`
   - Global users get ALL facilities

2. **Server-Side Plan Filtering** (Primary)
   - `maintenance_plan_list()` uses `allowed_don_vi_for_session_safe()`
   - Plans automatically filtered by region/role

3. **Client-Side Dropdown Validation** (Secondary)
   - Explicitly checks facility whitelist
   - Only shows allowed facilities

4. **Client-Side Selection Validation** (Secondary)
   - Validates selected facility before filtering
   - Aborts filter if unauthorized facility detected

5. **Client-Side UI Gating** (Tertiary)
   - Hides write buttons for regional_leader
   - Disables checkboxes for approved plans
   - Read-only mode enforcement

## How Facility Filter Works with Pagination

### Data Flow
```
1. Server returns ALL plans (region-filtered, no pagination)
   ↓
2. Client enriches with facility names
   ↓
3. Client filters by selected facility (entire dataset)
   ↓
4. Client resets pagination to page 1 (NEW!)
   ↓
5. TanStack Table applies pagination to filtered data
```

### Confirmation: Cross-Page Filtering Works
- ✅ Server fetches complete dataset (no server-side pagination)
- ✅ Client filters entire array, not just current page
- ✅ Pagination applied AFTER filtering
- ✅ Badge shows total filtered count, not page count
- ✅ Pagination resets when filter changes

## Regional Leader Permission Matrix

| **Feature** | **Regional Leader** | **Global User** |
|-------------|---------------------|----------------|
| View plans | ✅ Allowed | ✅ Allowed |
| View equipment lists | ✅ Allowed | ✅ Allowed |
| Create plan | ❌ Blocked | ✅ Allowed |
| Edit plan | ❌ Blocked | ✅ Allowed |
| Approve plan | ❌ Blocked | ✅ Allowed |
| Add equipment | ❌ Blocked | ✅ Allowed |
| Edit equipment | ❌ Blocked | ✅ Allowed |

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal:** All changes are client-side state updates
- **No additional API calls:** Same RPC call count
- **No re-renders:** Optimized with useMemo and useEffect
- **Faster RPC:** `get_facilities_with_equipment_count` more efficient than `don_vi_list`

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Security First:** Server-side filtering is primary defense, client-side is backup
2. **UX Matters:** Pagination reset prevents user confusion
3. **Read-Only Enforcement:** Multiple layers ensure regional_leader cannot modify data
4. **Regional Boundaries:** Strictly enforced at server and client levels
5. **Cross-Page Filtering:** Works correctly with complete dataset filtering

## Next Steps (Future Considerations)

1. Consider adding loading states for facility filter
2. Monitor RPC performance with large datasets
3. Add E2E tests for regional_leader scenarios
4. Consider caching facilities list to reduce RPC calls
5. Add analytics for filter usage patterns
