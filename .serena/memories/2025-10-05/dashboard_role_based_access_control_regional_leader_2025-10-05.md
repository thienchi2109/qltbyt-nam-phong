# Dashboard Role-Based Access Control for Regional Leaders

**Date**: October 5, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**  
**Component**: Dashboard Quick Actions

---

## What Was Accomplished

### Role-Based UI Restrictions
Successfully implemented client-side access control on the dashboard page to restrict regional leader users from accessing quick action buttons while maintaining their access to QR code scanning functionality.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Session Integration
- **File**: `src/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`
- **Added**: `useSession` hook from NextAuth
- **Added**: User role detection logic
- **Added**: `isRegionalLeader` boolean flag

```typescript
const { data: session } = useSession()
const user = session?.user as any
const isRegionalLeader = user?.role === 'regional_leader'
```

#### 2. Conditional Rendering Logic
- **Hidden for Regional Leaders**:
  - "Thêm thiết bị" (Add Equipment) button
  - "Lập kế hoạch" (Create Maintenance Plan) button
- **Always Available**:
  - "Quét mã QR" (QR Scanner) button

#### 3. Layout Adjustments
- **Regional Leader View**: QR scanner button centered using `md:col-start-2` class
- **Other Users**: All three buttons displayed in original grid layout

### Implementation Details

#### Before (All Users)
```
[Add Equipment] [Create Plan] [QR Scanner]
```

#### After (Regional Leaders)
```
           [QR Scanner]
```

#### After (Other Users)
```
[Add Equipment] [Create Plan] [QR Scanner]
```

### Security Considerations

#### Client-Side Guard
- **Purpose**: UX improvement to prevent confusion
- **Implementation**: Conditional rendering based on user role
- **Limitation**: Client-side only, server-side validation still required

#### Role Validation
- **Source**: NextAuth session JWT claims
- **Role Check**: `user?.role === 'regional_leader'`
- **Fallback**: Safely handles undefined/missing role data

### Business Logic

#### Regional Leader Permissions
- ✅ **Can Access**: QR scanner for equipment identification
- ❌ **Cannot Access**: Equipment creation (organizational function)
- ❌ **Cannot Access**: Maintenance plan creation (organizational function)

#### Rationale
- **QR Scanner**: Equipment viewing and identification is essential for regional oversight
- **Equipment Creation**: Organizational function that should be handled by tenant administrators
- **Maintenance Planning**: Organizational function that should be handled by tenant administrators

### Technical Implementation

#### Component Structure
```typescript
{/* Quick Actions: Restricted for regional leaders */}
{!isRegionalLeader && (
  <>
    <Button>/* Add Equipment */</Button>
    <Button>/* Create Maintenance Plan */</Button>
  </>
)}

{/* QR Scanner: Always available for all users including regional leaders */}
<Button className={isRegionalLeader ? 'md:col-start-2' : ''}>
  /* QR Scanner */
</Button>
```

#### Responsive Design
- **Mobile**: Single column layout maintained
- **Desktop**: Grid adjusts based on visible buttons
- **Centering**: QR scanner centered when only button visible

### Testing Requirements

#### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **Global Admin User**: Should see all three buttons
2. **Admin User**: Should see all three buttons
3. **Regional Leader User**: Should see only QR scanner (centered)
4. **Technician User**: Should see all three buttons
5. **Regular User**: Should see all three buttons

#### Test Accounts
- **Regional Leader**: `sytag-khtc / 1234`
- **Global Admin**: Test with global administrator account
- **Tenant Admin**: Test with organization administrator account

### Future Enhancements

#### Server-Side Validation
- **Recommended**: Add server-side role checks for add equipment and maintenance plan endpoints
- **Implementation**: RPC function role validation
- **Priority**: Medium (client-side guard sufficient for current requirements)

#### Extended Role-Based UI
- **Potential**: Apply similar restrictions to other dashboard components
- **Consideration**: KPI cards, calendar widget, tables may need role-based filtering
- **Impact**: Regional leaders may only need to see aggregated data

### Files Modified
1. `src/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added role-based UI restrictions

### Quality Assurance
- ✅ **TypeScript Compliance**: `npm run typecheck` passes without errors
- ✅ **UI Consistency**: Maintains responsive design principles
- ✅ **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels maintained
- ✅ **Performance**: No additional API calls or performance impact

### Documentation Status
- ✅ **Code Comments**: Inline comments explaining role-based logic
- ✅ **Memory Entry**: Comprehensive documentation created
- ✅ **Implementation Pattern**: Established for future role-based UI components

## Summary

Successfully implemented role-based access control for regional leaders on the dashboard page. The implementation:

1. **Restricts Access**: Regional leaders cannot see add equipment or maintenance plan buttons
2. **Maintains Functionality**: QR scanner remains accessible for equipment identification
3. **Provides Good UX**: Clean, centered layout when buttons are hidden
4. **Follows Best Practices**: Uses NextAuth session data for role validation
5. **Maintains Security**: Client-side guard for UX, server-side validation still recommended

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE AND READY FOR TESTING**

**Next Steps**: Manual testing with regional leader account to verify functionality
