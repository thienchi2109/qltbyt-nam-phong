# Project State: QLTB Nam Phong System (Updated 2025-09-27)

## System Overview
**Medical Equipment Management System** for Nam Phong with multi-tenant architecture, usage tracking, transfers, maintenance, and reporting.

## Current Architecture Status

### Multi-Tenant Security ✅ SECURED
- **Tenant Isolation**: Enforced at database level via JWT claims
- **Department Lists**: Fixed cross-tenant exposure vulnerability
- **Usage Logs**: Tenant-scoped queries implemented
- **Equipment Queries**: Proper tenant filtering in place
- **API Proxy**: RPC whitelist with tenant parameter sanitization

### Performance Status ✅ OPTIMIZED
- **Usage Log Queries**: Reduced from 500 to 50 rows with date windowing
- **Active Polling**: Reduced from 10s to 5min intervals (96% reduction)
- **Cache Strategy**: 5-minute stale time for historical data
- **Progressive Loading**: "Load More" functionality for historical data
- **Cache Invalidation**: Fixed equipment list refresh issues

### Database Functions Status ✅ CONSOLIDATED
- **equipment_list_enhanced**: Single definitive version with all filters
- **usage_log_list**: Enhanced with date windowing and pagination
- **departments_list**: Tenant-filtered to prevent data leakage
- **All RPC Functions**: Proper tenant isolation and permission checks

## Core Features & Status

- **Audit Trail**: Complete usage history with user attribution

### Transfer Management ✅ FUNCTIONAL
- **Internal Transfers**: Between departments within organization
- **External Transfers**: To external organizations with return tracking
- **Equipment Disposal**: Proper disposal workflow
- **Status Tracking**: Kanban-style status management
- **Department Filtering**: Fixed to show only relevant departments
- **Approval Workflow**: Multi-stage approval process

### Maintenance & Repairs ✅ FUNCTIONAL
- **Maintenance Planning**: Scheduled and ad-hoc maintenance
- **Repair Requests**: Full repair workflow management
- **Status Tracking**: Complete maintenance lifecycle
- **Reporting**: Maintenance statistics and performance metrics

### Reporting System ✅ FUNCTIONAL
- **Inventory Reports**: Equipment distribution and status
- **Usage Analytics**: Equipment utilization patterns
- **Maintenance Reports**: Maintenance performance metrics
- **Excel Export**: Full report export capabilities
- **Tenant Filtering**: Reports scoped to user permissions

### Authentication & Authorization ✅ SECURED
- **NextAuth Integration**: Secure authentication flow
- **Role-based Access**: Multiple role types with proper permissions
- **JWT Claims**: Secure tenant and role propagation
- **Client-side Routing**: Fixed redirect issues in protected routes

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
