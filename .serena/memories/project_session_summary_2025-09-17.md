# Session Summary - 2025-09-17

## NextAuth Migration (Completed)
- Verified NextAuth v4 is the active authentication system.
- Confirmed SessionProvider, middleware, and route protection in place.
- Cleaned a leftover comment and removed legacy AuthProvider backups.
- Dev server and login/logout tested successfully with NextAuth endpoints.

## Tenant Isolation Enforcement (Gateway)
- Implemented gateway-level p_don_vi sanitization for non-global users in /api/rpc/[fn]/route.ts.
- For all allowed RPCs, if a non-global user includes p_don_vi, it is coerced to the user’s don_vi from session.
- Prevents cross-tenant data access via client payload spoofing; global/admin behavior unchanged.

## Equipment Search UX
- Standardized empty results message to: “Không tìm thấy kết quả phù hợp” across:
  - Equipment page (table empty state)
  - Repair Requests (equipment search popover)
  - Transfers Add/Edit (equipment selection popover)
  - Maintenance Add Tasks dialog (table empty state)

## Bulk Equipment Import (Excel)
- Root cause: equipment_create RPC only inserted a subset of fields.
- Added migration `20250917_equipment_full_fields.sql` to expand equipment_create/update to handle all fields including:
  - model, serial, hang_san_xuat, noi_san_xuat, nam_san_xuat, ngay_nhap, ngay_dua_vao_su_dung, nguon_kinh_phi, gia_goc,
  - nam_tinh_hao_mon, ty_le_hao_mon, han_bao_hanh, vi_tri_lap_dat, nguoi_dang_truc_tiep_quan_ly, tinh_trang_hien_tai, ghi_chu,
  - chu_ky_bt_dinh_ky, ngay_bt_tiep_theo, chu_ky_hc_dinh_ky, ngay_hc_tiep_theo, chu_ky_kd_dinh_ky, ngay_kd_tiep_theo, phan_loai_theo_nd98.
- Updated importer normalization in `import-equipment-dialog.tsx`:
  - Dates -> YYYY-MM-DD; Excel serial dates supported.
  - Integers: nam_san_xuat, chu_ky_*; Numbers: gia_goc.
  - Classification uppercased.
  - Trimming and nulling of empty strings.

## Docs & Memories
- Updated README with accurate NextAuth and architecture docs.
- Added AUTHENTICATION.md for detailed NextAuth setup.
- Wrote `nextauth_migration_completed_2025-09-17` and `project_overview_updated_2025-09-17`.
- Marked legacy auth memory obsolete and removed outdated `project_overview` and `current_authentication_system`.

## Pending/Notes
- Apply new DB migration to Supabase (and reload PostgREST cache).
- Optionally reject mismatched p_don_vi in gateway (403) for non-global users.
- Consider extending gateway sanitization for alternate tenant param names if introduced later.
