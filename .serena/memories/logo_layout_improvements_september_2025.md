# Logo Layout Improvements - September 2025

## Issue Resolved
- Logo looked bad when forced into circular container wrapper
- The transparent background logo was being constrained by fixed circular dimensions

## Changes Made

### Login Page Layout (`src/app/page.tsx`)
**Before:**
```tsx
<div className="bg-white/20 w-16 h-16 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center mx-auto mb-4">
  <Logo />
</div>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<div className="flex justify-center mb-4">
  <Logo />
</div>
```

### Logo Component Enhancement (`src/components/icons.tsx`)
- Made Logo component flexible with customizable className prop
- Default size remains 64x64 but now allows override
- Added `w-16 h-16` as default classes
- Maintains `object-contain` for proper aspect ratio

```tsx
export const Logo = ({ className = "w-16 h-16" }: { className?: string }) => (
  <Image
    src="https://i.postimg.cc/26dHxmnV/89307731ad9526cb7f84-1-Photoroom.png"
    alt="Logo"
    width={64}
    height={64}
    className={`object-contain ${className}`}
  />
);
```

## Result
- Logo now "floats" naturally without circular constraints
- Better visual appearance with transparent background
- More flexible for different screen sizes and contexts
- Maintains consistent branding across all components
