# Equipment Page Pagination Reset Fix - 2025-09-27

## Issue Resolved
✅ **Filtered results now automatically jump to first page**

### Problem Description
When applying filters on the equipment page:
- Results matching the filter criteria didn't appear on the current page
- Users had to manually navigate to find where filtered results were located
- This created a confusing UX where filters seemed "broken"

**User feedback**: "Tôi phải chuyển trang đến đúng vị trí của bản ghi thỏa điều kiện lọc thì mới nhìn thấy bản ghi đó, nó không tự nhảy lên đầu trang"

### Root Cause
The pagination state wasn't resetting when filters changed:
- User on page 3 applies "Người sử dụng = Nguyễn Thiên Chi"
- System queries filtered results but still shows page 3
- Filtered results start on page 1, so page 3 appears empty
- User thinks filter isn't working

### Solution Implemented
**File**: `src/app/(app)/equipment/page.tsx` (lines 1349-1363)

Added smart pagination reset logic that:
1. **Tracks filter changes** using memoized filter key
2. **Resets to page 1** only when filters actually change AND user is not on page 1
3. **Prevents infinite loops** by tracking last filter state

```typescript
// Reset pagination to page 1 when filters change
const filterKey = React.useMemo(() => 
  JSON.stringify({ filters: columnFilters, search: debouncedSearch }),
  [columnFilters, debouncedSearch]
)
const [lastFilterKey, setLastFilterKey] = React.useState(filterKey)

React.useEffect(() => {
  if (filterKey !== lastFilterKey && pagination.pageIndex > 0) {
    setPagination(prev => ({ ...prev, pageIndex: 0 }))
    setLastFilterKey(filterKey)
  } else if (filterKey !== lastFilterKey) {
    setLastFilterKey(filterKey)
  }
}, [filterKey, lastFilterKey, pagination.pageIndex])
```

### Technical Benefits

1. **Smart Detection**: Only resets when filters actually change, not on every render
2. **Conditional Reset**: Only resets pagination when user is not already on page 1
3. **Performance**: Memoized filter key prevents unnecessary calculations
4. **Loop Prevention**: State tracking prevents infinite re-render cycles
5. **Comprehensive**: Handles both column filters and search term changes

### UX Impact

**Before**:
- Apply filter → Stay on current page → See "no results" → Manually navigate to find results
- Confusing experience, users think filters are broken

**After**:
- Apply filter → Automatically jump to page 1 → See filtered results immediately
- Intuitive behavior matching user expectations

### Filter Types Covered
- **Department filters** (Khoa/Phòng)
- **User filters** (Người sử dụng)
- **Location filters** (Vị trí lắp đặt)
- **Classification filters** (Phân loại theo NĐ98)
- **Status filters** (Tình trạng)
- **Search term changes** (Tìm kiếm chung)

### Implementation Details

#### Filter Key Generation
Combines all filter state into a stable string:
```typescript
JSON.stringify({ filters: columnFilters, search: debouncedSearch })
```

#### State Tracking
Uses React state to remember the last filter configuration:
- Prevents unnecessary pagination resets
- Ensures reset only happens when filters actually change
- Avoids resetting when user manually navigates pages without changing filters

#### Conditional Logic
- **Case 1**: Filters changed + user on page > 1 → Reset to page 1
- **Case 2**: Filters changed + user on page 1 → Update tracking only
- **Case 3**: No filter change → No action

### Testing Scenarios

✅ **Scenario 1**: User on page 3 → Apply department filter → Jump to page 1 with results
✅ **Scenario 2**: User on page 1 → Apply filter → Stay on page 1 (no unnecessary reset)
✅ **Scenario 3**: User applies same filter twice → No pagination reset
✅ **Scenario 4**: User changes search term → Reset to page 1
✅ **Scenario 5**: User manually navigates pages without changing filters → No reset

### Performance Characteristics

- **Memory**: Minimal overhead with memoized filter key
- **CPU**: Single JSON.stringify per filter change
- **Renders**: No extra renders, only when necessary state changes
- **Network**: No additional API calls

### Multi-tenant Compatibility

- ✅ Works with tenant-aware filtering
- ✅ Compatible with global user tenant switching
- ✅ Handles filter option loading states gracefully
- ✅ Maintains security through server-side filtering

### Integration with Existing Features

- ✅ **Preservation Logic**: Works alongside existing page state preservation
- ✅ **Search Debouncing**: Integrates with debounced search functionality
- ✅ **Multi-select Filters**: Compatible with array-based department filtering
- ✅ **Manual Pagination**: Doesn't interfere with manual page navigation

This fix ensures that when users apply filters, they immediately see the relevant results starting from page 1, creating a smooth and intuitive filtering experience that matches standard data table expectations.
