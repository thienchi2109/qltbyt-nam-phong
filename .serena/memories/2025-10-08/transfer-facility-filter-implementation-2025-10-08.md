# Transfer Page Facility Filter Implementation

**Date Completed:** October 8, 2025  
**Branch:** feat/regional_leader  
**Status:** ✅ Complete and tested

## Summary
Added facility filter to transfer requests page for consistency with maintenance, equipment, and repair-requests pages. Regional leaders and global users can now filter transfers by facility.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration
**File:** `supabase/migrations/2025-10-08/202510081450_add_facility_name_to_transfer_list.sql`
- Modified `transfer_request_list_enhanced` RPC function
- Added `LEFT JOIN public.don_vi dv ON dv.id = tb.don_vi`
- Extended thiet_bi JSONB with `facility_name` and `facility_id` fields
- Backward compatible - only adds new fields
- Security unchanged - uses `allowed_don_vi_for_session()`
- **Status:** Applied in Supabase SQL Editor and tested

### 2. TypeScript Types
**File:** `src/types/database.ts`
- Updated `TransferRequest.thiet_bi` to inline type (repair-requests pattern)
- Added: `id`, `facility_name`, `facility_id`, `serial_number`, `tinh_trang`
- Maintains optional fields for backward compatibility

### 3. Frontend Implementation
**File:** `src/app/(app)/transfers/page.tsx`
- Added state: `selectedFacility`, `facilities`, `showFacilityFilter`
- Added useEffect to fetch facilities via `get_facilities_with_equipment_count`
- Added useMemo for `displayedTransfers` with facility filtering
- Updated `getTransfersByStatus` to use `displayedTransfers`
- Added Select dropdown with Building2 icon in CardHeader
- Shows facility count badges in dropdown

### 4. Type Safety Fixes
**File:** `src/components/edit-transfer-dialog.tsx`
- Added null check for `thiet_bi.id` before creating `EquipmentWithDept`

## Testing Results
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ Migration applied successfully in Supabase
- ✅ Facility filter works properly on transfers page
- ✅ Regional leaders can filter by facility
- ✅ Global users can filter by facility
- ✅ Kanban board respects facility filter

## Pattern Consistency
Transfer page now follows the same facility filtering pattern as:
- Maintenance page (lines 286-306, 1951-2002)
- Equipment page
- Repair requests page (lines 320-434)

## Security Model
- Uses `allowed_don_vi_for_session()` for multi-facility access
- Regional leaders see all facilities in their `dia_ban`
- Client-side filtering only - security enforced server-side
- Read-only access maintained for regional_leader role
