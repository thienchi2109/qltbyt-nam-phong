This caused an infinite loop error with Radix UI Select components.\n\n## Root Cause\nWhen TanStack Table column definitions are recreated (due to dependency changes in useMemo), all cell components are remounted. Radix UI's Select component uses `composeRefs` internally, and rapid mount/unmount cycles trigger recursive ref updates causing \"Maximum update depth exceeded\" errors.\n\n## Specific Issues Found\n\n### 1. Column factory function with changing dependencies\n```typescript\n// BAD: editingTaskId in dependencies causes columns to recreate on every edit\nconst taskColumns = React.useMemo(\n  () =\u003e createTaskColumns({ isPlanApproved, editingTaskId, canCompleteTask }),\n  [isPlanApproved, editingTaskId, canCompleteTask]\n)\n```\n\n### 2. Radix UI Select in table cells\nThe Select component's ref composition (`compose-refs.tsx`) loops when cells remount rapidly:\n```\nat setRef (compose-refs.tsx:11:12)\nat compose-refs.tsx:25:23\nat Array.map (\u003canonymous\u003e)\n...recursive...\n```\n\n### 3. Hook returning new object references\n```typescript\n// BAD: Returns new object every render\nreturn { tasks, setTasks, draftTasks, ... }\n\n// ATTEMPTED FIX (still failed):\nreturn React.useMemo(() =\u003e ({ ... }), [deps])\n```\n\n## What We Tried (All Failed)\n1. ✗ Memoizing the hook's return object with useMemo\n2. ✗ Removing editingTaskId from column dependencies, reading from meta instead\n3. ✗ Replacing Radix Select with native HTML select\n4. ✗ Adding stable keys to Select components\n\n## Safe Refactoring Rules for TanStack Table\n\n1. **NEVER put frequently-changing state in column useMemo dependencies**\n   - editingTaskId, editingTaskData change on every edit action\n   - Read these from table.options.meta instead\n\n2. **Avoid Radix UI Select in table cells when editing state changes columns**\n   - Native `\u003cselect\u003e` may be safer but still had issues\n   - Consider inline editing with Input only\n\n3. **Column definitions should be as stable as possible**\n   - Only isPlanApproved and canCompleteTask (rarely change) should be in deps\n   - All dynamic state should come from table meta\n\n4. **Test incrementally after each extraction**\n   - Don't batch multiple extractions before testing\n   - The infinite loop only appeared after several changes were combined\n\n## Resolution\nReverted to commit `519d986` (before Phase 4 changes). Phase 3 extractions (PlanFiltersBar, PlansTable, TasksTable, MobileMaintenanceLayout) work correctly.\n\n## Future Approach\nIf revisiting this refactoring:\n1. Keep column definitions inline in page.tsx\n2. Only extract pure presentational components (no table cell logic)\n3. Extract dialogs separately from column logic\n4. Test after EACH small change","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-26T14:56:47.9540101+07:00","updated_at":"2026-01-07T16:49:26.689778+07:00","closed_at":"2025-12-26T14:57:37.3028063+07:00","close_reason":"Documented as episodic memory for future reference"}

{"id":"qltbyt-nam-phong-hrx","title":"LESSON: TanStack Table column extraction causes infinite loops with Radix UI","description":"## Context\nDuring Phase 4 maintenance page refactoring, we attempted to extract column definitions into factory functions. This caused an infinite loop error with Radix UI Select components.\n\n## Root Cause\nWhen TanStack Table column definitions are recreated (due to dependency changes in useMemo), all cell components are remounted. Radix UI's Select component uses `composeRefs` internally, and rapid mount/unmount cycles trigger recursive ref updates causing \"Maximum update depth exceeded\" errors.\n\n## Specific Issues Found\n\n### 1. Column factory function with changing dependencies\n```typescript\n// BAD: editingTaskId in dependencies causes columns to recreate on every edit\nconst taskColumns = React.useMemo(\n  () =\u003e createTaskColumns({ isPlanApproved, editingTaskId, canCompleteTask }),\n  [isPlanApproved, editingTaskId, canCompleteTask]\n)\n```\n\n### 2. Radix UI Select in table cells\nThe Select component's ref composition (`compose-refs.tsx`) loops when cells remount rapidly:\n```\nat setRef (compose-refs.tsx:11:12)\nat compose-refs.tsx:25:23\nat Array.map (\u003canonymous\u003e)\n...recursive...\n```\n\n### 3. Hook returning new object references\n```typescript\n// BAD: Returns new object every render\nreturn { tasks, setTasks, draftTasks, ... }\n\n// ATTEMPTED FIX (still failed):\nreturn React.useMemo(() =\u003e ({ ... }), [deps])\n```\n\n## What We Tried (All Failed)\n1. ✗ Memoizing the hook's return object with useMemo\n2. ✗ Removing editingTaskId from column dependencies, reading from meta instead\n3. ✗ Replacing Radix Select with native HTML select\n4. ✗ Adding stable keys to Select components\n\n## Safe Refactoring Rules for TanStack Table\n\n1. **NEVER put frequently-changing state in column useMemo dependencies**\n   - editingTaskId, editingTaskData change on every edit action\n   - Read these from table.options.meta instead\n\n2. **Avoid Radix UI Select in table cells when editing state changes columns**\n   - Native `\u003cselect\u003e` may be safer but still had issues\n   - Consider inline editing with Input only\n\n3. **Column definitions should be as stable as possible**\n   - Only isPlanApproved and canCompleteTask (rarely change) should be in deps\n   - All dynamic state should come from table meta\n\n4. **Test incrementally after each extraction**\n   - Don't batch multiple extractions before testing\n   - The infinite loop only appeared after several changes were combined\n\n## Resolution\nReverted to commit `519d986` (before Phase 4 changes). Phase 3 extractions (PlanFiltersBar, PlansTable, TasksTable, MobileMaintenanceLayout) work correctly.\n\n## Future Approach\nIf revisiting this refactoring:\n1. Keep column definitions inline in page.tsx\n2. Only extract pure presentational components (no table cell logic)\n3. Extract dialogs separately from column logic\n4. Test after EACH small change","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-26T14:56:47.9540101+07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-26T14:57:37.3028063+07:00","closed_at":"2025-12-26T14:57:37.3028063+07:00","close_reason":"Documented as episodic memory for future reference"}
