refactor(rr/filters): single clear control resets status/date/search and facility to show all results (OpenSpec)

Summary
- Hide duplicate "Xóa tất cả" in chips; keep a single "Xóa" button near filters
- Clear now resets: column filters, uiFilters (status/date), search term, and facility (to all) for roles that can switch facility
- Ensures server query shows all results scoped by tenant/role (regional leader/global see all facilities; others remain tenant-scoped by proxy)

Files
- src/app/(app)/repair-requests/_components/FilterChips.tsx
- src/app/(app)/repair-requests/page.tsx

QA Notes
- Click "Xóa" shows full list immediately; chips disappear; facility dropdown resets to "Tất cả" when visible
- Typecheck passes
