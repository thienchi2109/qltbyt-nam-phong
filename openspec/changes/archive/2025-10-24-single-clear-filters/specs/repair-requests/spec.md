## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Clear Filters Behavior (Repair Requests)
The system SHALL provide a single clear filters control that resets all applied filters and shows all results within the user's allowed scope.

#### Scenario: Toolbar clear resets to all
- **WHEN** the user clicks "XÃ³a"
- **THEN** status/date/search filters are cleared and facility resets to all (when visible)
- **AND** the list refreshes to show all tenant/region-scoped results
