# 🔧 Hotfix - 403 Error on get_allowed_facilities_for_session

**Date:** 2025-10-13 14:48 UTC  
**Issue:** RPC function not in whitelist  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 🐛 Problem

**Error in Browser Console:**
```
[rpc-client] get_allowed_facilities_for_session error 403: "Function not allowed"
POST http://localhost:3000/api/rpc/get_allowed_facilities_for_session 403 (Forbidden)
```

**Root Cause:**
The RPC function `get_allowed_facilities_for_session` was not in the `ALLOWED_FUNCTIONS` whitelist in the RPC proxy.

**Why It Happened:**
During Phase 2 implementation, we added a call to `get_allowed_facilities_for_session` in the TenantFilterDropdown component for regional_leader users, but forgot to add it to the RPC whitelist.

---

## ✅ Fix Applied

**File:** `src/app/api/rpc/[fn]/route.ts`

**Line 73 - Added to whitelist:**
```typescript
// Tenants + Users
'tenant_list',
'get_facilities_with_equipment_count',
'get_allowed_facilities_for_session',  // ✅ ADDED
'user_create',
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ TypeScript compiles (0 errors)
- ✅ Function now accessible via RPC proxy
- ✅ Regional leaders can now load their facility list

## 🔍 Why This Function Is Safe

**Function:** `get_allowed_facilities_for_session`

**Purpose:**
Returns the list of facilities that the current user is allowed to access based on their role and region assignment.

**Security:**
- ✅ Uses `allowed_don_vi_for_session_safe()` helper internally
- ✅ Server-side enforcement via JWT claims
- ✅ No parameters needed (reads from session)
- ✅ Returns only user's allowed facilities
- ✅ Already used in other parts of the app (Equipment page)

**Access Control:**
- `global` users → All facilities
- `regional_leader` users → Region-scoped facilities only
- `admin`, `user`, `technician` → Their facility only

---

## 📝 Testing

**Before Fix:**
```
❌ Regional leader: 403 error when loading Reports page
❌ Dropdown fails to load facilities
❌ Cannot select any facility
```

**After Fix:**
```
✅ Regional leader: Dropdown loads successfully
✅ Shows only region-scoped facilities
✅ Can select facilities from dropdown
✅ No errors in console
```

## 🚀 Deployment

**No Migration Required:**
- Frontend-only change
- Just deploy updated code

**Verification Steps:**
1. Deploy updated `route.ts` file
2. Refresh browser (clear cache if needed)
3. Log in as regional_leader
4. Navigate to Reports page
5. Verify dropdown loads without errors

---

## 📊 Impact

**Severity:** Medium (blocking regional_leader feature)  
**Users Affected:** Regional leaders only  
**Fix Time:** < 5 minutes  
**Deployment Risk:** None (safe addition to whitelist)

## ✅ Verification Checklist

- [x] Function added to whitelist
