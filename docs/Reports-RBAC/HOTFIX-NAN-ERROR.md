# 🔧 Hotfix - NaN Error in Equipment Distribution

**Date:** 2025-10-13 14:56 UTC  
**Issue:** Division by zero causing NaN  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 🐛 Problem

**Error in Console:**
```
Received NaN for the `children` attribute. If this is expected, cast the value to a string.
```

**Location:**
- Component: `EquipmentDistributionSummary`
- File: `src/components/equipment-distribution-summary.tsx`
- Lines: 171, 187

**Root Cause:**
When a regional_leader selects a facility that has equipment but no departments or locations with equipment, the component divides by 0:

```typescript
// Line 171 - BEFORE (WRONG)
{Math.round(overallStats.totalEquipment / overallStats.departmentCount)}
// If departmentCount = 0, this results in NaN

// Line 187 - BEFORE (WRONG)
{Math.round(overallStats.totalEquipment / overallStats.locationCount)}
// If locationCount = 0, this results in NaN
```

**Why This Happens:**
- Some facilities might have equipment but no assigned departments
- Some facilities might have equipment but no specified locations
- This is valid data but causes division by zero

---

## ✅ Fix Applied

**File:** `src/components/equipment-distribution-summary.tsx`

**Line 171-173 (Departments):**
```typescript
// BEFORE (causes NaN)
{Math.round(overallStats.totalEquipment / overallStats.departmentCount)}

// AFTER (safe)
{overallStats.departmentCount > 0 
  ? Math.round(overallStats.totalEquipment / overallStats.departmentCount)
  : 0}
```

**Line 189-191 (Locations):**
```typescript
// BEFORE (causes NaN)
{Math.round(overallStats.totalEquipment / overallStats.locationCount)}

// AFTER (safe)
{overallStats.locationCount > 0 
  ? Math.round(overallStats.totalEquipment / overallStats.locationCount)
  : 0}
```

## 🔍 Why This Fix Is Correct

### Safe Math
- ✅ Checks for division by zero before calculation
- ✅ Returns 0 as a sensible default (no average if no items)
- ✅ Preserves correct calculation when count > 0

### User Experience
- ✅ No more React warnings in console
- ✅ Displays "0" instead of empty/broken card
- ✅ Clear indication that there are no departments/locations to average

### Edge Cases Handled
- ✅ Facility with equipment but no departments
- ✅ Facility with equipment but no locations
- ✅ Empty facility (0 equipment, 0 departments, 0 locations)

## 📊 Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Facility
```
Equipment: 100
Departments: 5
Locations: 10

Average per department: 100/5 = 20 ✅
Average per location: 100/10 = 10 ✅
```

### Scenario 2: Equipment Without Departments (Was Broken)
```
Equipment: 50
Departments: 0
Locations: 8

Average per department: 0 ✅ (instead of NaN ❌)
Average per location: 50/8 = 6 ✅
```

### Scenario 3: Equipment Without Locations (Was Broken)
```
Equipment: 30
Departments: 3
Locations: 0

Average per department: 30/3 = 10 ✅
Average per location: 0 ✅ (instead of NaN ❌)
```

## ✅ Verification

**TypeScript:** ✅ 0 errors  
**Files Modified:** 1  
**Lines Changed:** 2

**Test Scenarios:**
- [ ] Regional leader selects facility with equipment but no departments
- [ ] Regional leader selects facility with equipment but no locations
- [ ] Global user selects "All facilities" (might aggregate empty facilities)
- [ ] No React warnings in console

## 🚀 Deployment

**No Migration Required:**
- Frontend-only change
- Pure display logic fix

**Impact:**
- Low risk (defensive programming)
- Improves error handling
- Better user experience
